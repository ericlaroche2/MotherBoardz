Shopify's Mobile Intern Challenge - Winter 2019

Please run the application on Nexus 5x for the best user interface. Thank you !



1. The main screen allows you to select whether you want to see all the list of products or all the list of product tags.
2. If the user selects the tag button, one will be redirected to a page with a list of tags sorted alphabetically. The listView contains the name of the tag along with the number of products that has this tag name.
3. Clicking on any tag will redirect the user to a screen with all the products with that specific tag

Extras
- nice UI
- cute placeholder images for the tag list
